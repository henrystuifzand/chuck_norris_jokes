# Chuck Norris Jokes SAPUI5 App

This app is powered by the [Internet Chuck Norris Database API]. It displays a random Chuck Norris nerdy joke and the values are escaped for JavaScript usage. This is achieved with the following API call:

```javascript
http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?limitTo=[nerdy]&escape=javascript
```
The app was created by [Denise Nepraunig] in September 2015. You can follow me on twitter [@denisenepraunig].

## Application Info
The application was build with [SAP] technology and was developed with my free [trial account].

Have a look at the [SCN blog post] for feedback.

## Technical info
- mobile first
- [SAPUI5] 1.30 app
- hosted on [HANA Cloud Platform] = HCP
- deployed as [HTML5 application] on HCP
- uses [destination service] from HCP to access the API
- build with [SAP Web IDE]
- minified with [Application Build] in the SAP Web IDE


## Deploying to your HCP trial account
The fastest way to deploy this application is the following:

- zip this **chuck_norris_jokes** folder *(Attention Mac Users -> see (1))**
- import the **chucknorrisjokes** file from the **destination folder** in your HCP cockpit -> **Destinations**
- start your **SAP Web IDE** in the HCP cockpit -> **Subscriptions**
- in the SAP Web IDE home screen choose **Import** -> **Archive**
- right click the new folder and choose **Deploy** -> Deploy to *SAP HANA Cloud Platform**
- click **Deploy** in the dialog
- click on the **Open the active version...**
- DONE! ;-)

(1) The Finder's *Compress* command creates an additional folder, which we don't need inside the SAP Web IDE.

Your folder structure should look like this:
